# F-SAC
Functional-Segment Activity Coefficient model

The F-SAC model is an activity coefficient model for mixtures. Its purpose is similar to the UNIFAC model.

The F-SAC model is based on the concept of functional groups but with the interaction energies between groups determined as in the COSMO-RS theory.

Most model parameters are for functional groups alone (not pairwise). This increases the predition power of the model and reduces the dependency from experimental data for model calibration. The only binary parameters of the model are the hydrogen bond (HB) formation energies.
